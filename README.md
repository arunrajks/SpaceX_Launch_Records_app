The project employs a range of methodologies, encompassing `data collection`, `data wrangling`, `exploratory data analysis` (EDA) with `data visualization` and `SQL`, as well as creating `interactive maps and dashboards`. These approaches enable a comprehensive assessment of launch success factors and predictive model development.
