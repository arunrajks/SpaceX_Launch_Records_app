## Introduction

In this capstone project, the objective is to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. The context is set in the commercial space industry, particularly with SpaceX, which offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at a significantly lower cost compared to other providers. The key cost-saving factor is SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. The project aims to develop a predictive model for the successful landing of this crucial component. The successful landing prediction is valuable because it directly influences the cost of a launch. This information becomes strategic for companies considering bidding against SpaceX for rocket launches, providing insights into the potential expenses involved.

The project employs a range of methodologies, encompassing `data collection`, `data wrangling`, `exploratory data analysis` (EDA) with `data visualization` and `SQL`, as well as creating `interactive maps and dashboards`. These approaches enable a comprehensive assessment of launch success factors and predictive model development.
